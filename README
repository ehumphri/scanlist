Scanlist 
========

   I regularly end up with random text files with lots of different notations of networks, and ip ranges from customers. This script aims to make cleanup and validation of ip addresses quick and easy. 

# Prerequesites / Installation

   easy_install ipaddress
   copy the .py file to your system and run 

# Usage:

 ## View the usage output 

   shell$ python scanlist.py -h addresses.txt 
   scanlist.py -i <inputfile>
   shell$ 

 ## Select a file of addresses (included in the github repo for testing):

   shell$ python scanlist.py -i addresses.txt
